# What-if games with 2024 UK election results

This little app lets you see what the results of the 2024 UK general election might have been if a
certain proportion of voters for one party actually voted for another.

I made it because I wanted to see what would happen if some RUK voters voted for the Tories instead.

## todo

- [ ] make a checkbox list of parties to show (without OTHWin)
- [ ] add an "other" for parties not shown
- [ ] make the sliders at the bottom configurable with "from", "to" including "not voting"
